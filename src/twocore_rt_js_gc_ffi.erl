%%% twocore_rt_js_gc_ffi — the deep BEAM-term walk for `rt_js_gc`
%%% (SPEC §7.M2; M2.md:177-196).
%%%
%%% Hand-written Erlang, so it carries the `twocore_` namespace prefix
%%% (overview §5) and can NEVER collide with an OTP module — exactly like
%%% `twocore_rt_js_store_ffi`. Pure term walk: no NIF, no process state,
%%% cannot crash the node.
%%%
%%% Why a shim: `refs_in_term/2` recurses into a fun's captured environment
%%% via `erlang:fun_info(F, env)` — the load-bearing case (M2-I8) that keeps
%%% a JS closure's captured Handle bindings alive across GC. Gleam has no
%%% way to name a fun's env, so this is the ONE piece inexpressible there.

%% refs_in_term(Term, Acc) -> [Int | Acc]
%% Deep walk: push every `{js_cell, N}` id reachable inside Term onto Acc.
%% Recurses into tuples/lists/maps AND a fun's captured env, so a JS closure
%% stored in a cell keeps its captured handles alive. Total: any leaf term
%% (atom | number | binary | ref | pid | port | []) contributes nothing.
