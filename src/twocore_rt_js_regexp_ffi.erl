%% JS RegExp -> PCRE (`re`) bridge: JS flags to re:compile options, the source
%% pattern scan (group count / named groups), the escape + v-mode class
%% translation, the compiled-pattern cache and exec.
%%
%% Three neighbours own the parts that are not about `re`:
%%   twocore_rt_js_regex_vclass  — the v-flag ClassSetExpression parser (nested classes,
%%     &&, --, \q{...}, properties of strings). Called at the one point
%%     translate_pat/5 meets a `[` under the v flag.
%%   twocore_rt_js_regex_charset — the codepoint set algebra (union/intersection/
%%     complement over ranges), simple case folding, and rendering a set back
%%     to a PCRE class. Pure, no `re` dependency.
%%   arc_bytes_ffi     — byte-offset UTF-8 slicing, shared with the lexer.
%%     re:run returns byte indices, so the Gleam caller slices byte-wise; it
%%     calls arc_bytes_ffi directly (unsafe_slice/3, drop_start/2,
%%     next_char_boundary/2) rather than through forwarders here, so there is
%%     one name and one out-of-range policy for those three functions.
-module(twocore_rt_js_regexp_ffi).
-export([regexp_exec_info/5]).
%% Shared with twocore_rt_js_regex_vclass — the same trail-surrogate reader both the
%% general translation and the v-class parser use.
-export([pair_trail/1]).

%% The codepoint-set algebra module, abbreviated: it appears often enough in
%% the v-mode class evaluator that spelling it out would hide the code.
-define(CS, twocore_rt_js_regex_charset).

%% translate_pat/5's InClass parameter is three-valued, not a boolean:
%%   false — outside a character class.
%%   true  — inside `[...]`, and the previous item CANNOT be a range low
%%           endpoint: the class just opened (`[` or `[^`), or the previous item
%%           was a class escape, a property escape, or a range that completed.
%%   atom  — inside `[...]`, and the previous item CAN be a range low endpoint
%%           (a literal character or a single-character escape).
%% The extra bit exists to decide whether a `-` is a range operator or a
%% literal, which JS and PCRE agree on but which this module must know for
%% itself: only a real range operator may clamp a lone-surrogate high endpoint
%% (see translate_range_hi/4). `[-\uD800]` and `[a-b-\uD800]` are literal
%% dashes; `[a-\uD800]` is a range.
-define(IN_CLASS(X), (X =:= true orelse X =:= atom)).

%% Convert JS flags to re:compile options.
%%
%% `i` is the only flag PCRE can be trusted with directly. `m` and `s` are NOT
%% passed through: PCRE's line-terminator set is LF-only (JS's LineTerminator is
%% {LF, CR, U+2028, U+2029}) and PCRE's `$` also matches before a trailing
%% newline, so `multiline`/`dotall` give the wrong answer for /a$/.test("a\n")
%% and /^b/m.test("a\rb"). Instead `.`, `^` and `$` are desugared in
%% translate_pat/5 against ?JS_LT — the same "spell the JS set out rather than
%% trust PCRE's" policy that \s, \w and \b already follow in this module.

%% newline_mode(Flags) -> {Multiline, DotAll} — the two flags translate_pat/5

%%
%% The failure shape is one of the `regexp:ExecFailure` constructors the Gleam
%% caller matches on — a pattern PCRE cannot compile is NOT the same thing as
%% a pattern that failed to match, and neither side may confuse them. A compile
%% failure is not necessarily an arc bug: PCRE rejects constructs that are legal
%% ECMAScript, e.g. an unbounded-length lookbehind like `(?<=^\w+)`. It is
%% cached like a success, so a script exec'ing such a regexp in a loop pays the
%% translation + compile once, not once per call.
%%
%% Get a compiled pattern, caching it in the process dictionary. re:run/3
%% with a binary pattern recompiles the PCRE pattern on every call, and the
%% global match/replace/split loops at the Gleam level call exec once per
%% match — so a /g operation with k matches compiled the same regex k times.
%% Caching the compiled MP makes that one compile + k cheap match calls.
%% Translation happens behind the same cache: property escapes can expand
%% into multi-kilobyte classes, so re-translating per exec would dominate
%% tight test()/exec loops over short subjects. The scan of the source
%% pattern (group count + named groups) is cached alongside the MP, so
%% regexp_exec_info gets it for free on a hit. Keyed by the ORIGINAL pattern
%% plus {CompileOpts, UnicodeMode, NewlineMode} — every compilation and
%% translation input — so flag chars that affect none of them (g/y/d/etc.)

%% Script=X -> sc:X, Script_Extensions=X -> scx:X, Assigned -> negated Cn).
%% Backslash escapes are consumed in pairs so an escaped backslash (\\) before

%% is what RegExp.prototype.source returns; this only affects what re sees.

%%             says the previous class item can be a range low endpoint.
%%   Mode    — none | u | v: whether property escapes / v-flag class-set
%%             expressions are in play.
%%   CI      — the i flag. It changes what a class must contain: PCRE folds
%%             every class item at match time, so an emitted set has to be

%% The three failures are DISTINCT and the caller (regexp.gleam's ExecFailure)
%% must treat them so: only no_match/offset_out_of_range are "the regex did not
%% match"; a pattern PCRE cannot compile is an engine-level failure.
%%
%% Offset and the returned Start/Length are BYTE indices into the UTF-8
%% binary — the Gleam caller slices with byte_slice/byte_drop_start and steps
%% empty matches with next_char_boundary, so no grapheme conversion happens
%% on either side. re:run/3 raises badarg for the two offsets JS treats as a
%% failed match — past the end of the string, or mid-UTF-8-character — so both
%% are rejected by the guards below BEFORE re:run sees them, and no badarg is
%% caught anywhere in this module: any other badarg is a bug here and must
%% crash rather than masquerade as "the regex didn't match".
%% A negative Offset is clamped to 0 (ToLength, §7.1.20).
%% Additionally:
%%   - Sticky=true anchors the match at Offset (JS `y` flag semantics),
%%   - WholeMatch is the {Start, Length} of capture 0 — split out so the Gleam
%%     caller's type never admits an empty capture list (a PCRE match always
%%     has one),
%%   - Groups is captures 1..N padded with {-1, 0} up to GroupCount entries
%%     (PCRE omits trailing unset groups; JS exposes them as undefined),
%%   - Names is [{GroupName, CaptureIndex}] for (?<name>...) groups, in
%%     source order, so the caller can build the `groups` object.
