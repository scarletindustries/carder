//// Insertion-ordered key → value store — the spec's append-only [[MapData]] /
//// [[SetData]] list, backing both Map and Set.
////
//// A `Dict` alone gives O(log n) lookup but loses insertion order, so order
//// is modelled with monotonically increasing sequence numbers:
////
////   - `entries`  live key → #(insertion sequence number, value)
////   - `order`    insertion sequence number → live key (inverse of `entries`)
////   - `next_seq` the next sequence number to assign; never reset
////
//// A key's seq lives *inside* its entry, so a live key and its seq cannot
//// disagree — the only remaining relationship is that `order` is the inverse
//// of `entries`, maintained by `insert`/`delete`, which read that seq from
//// the single place it is stored.
////
//// `delete` removes the record from both dicts; the gap it leaves in the seq
//// space is the spec's "emptied" record, skipped by iterator cursors. A
//// deleted-then-re-inserted key gets a fresh seq past every live iterator's
//// cursor, so it is revisited (§24.1.5 / §24.2.5). `clear` empties the dicts
//// but keeps `next_seq`, so entries added after a clear still land past
//// in-flight cursors. An overwrite of a live key keeps its original seq.
////
//// The type is opaque so the invariant — `order` maps exactly the seqs held
//// by `entries` back to their keys, and `next_seq` is strictly greater than
//// every assigned seq — cannot be broken from outside. Every state a caller
//// can reach through this API satisfies it.
