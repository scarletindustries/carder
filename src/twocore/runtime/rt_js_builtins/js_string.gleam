//// JS-string primitives — the counterparts of `gleam/string` that measure a
//// string in JS string units rather than grapheme clusters.
////
//// A grapheme cluster is never a JS string unit, so `gleam/string.length`,
//// `.slice`, `.drop_start` and `.to_graphemes` must not appear on any path
//// that measures or indexes a JS string value; use these instead. All five
//// walk UTF-8 codepoints in FFI (~20x faster than the grapheme-clustering
//// `gleam/string` equivalents, which go through `unicode_util:gc`).
////
//// TODO(Deviation): JS indexes by UTF-16 code unit, so astral-plane chars
//// should count as 2 indices. Codepoint indexing matches code-unit indexing
//// for all BMP chars, so this is strictly more correct than grapheme
//// indexing was. Full fix needs UTF-16 string storage.
