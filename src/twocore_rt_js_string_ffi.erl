%% Fast string indexing by codepoint (not grapheme cluster). Gleam's
%% string.slice/string.length do grapheme segmentation via unicode_util:gc
%% which is ~20x slower and spec-incorrect for JS (which uses UTF-16 code
%% units). Codepoints are closer to correct and far cheaper.
%%
%% Consumers: rt_js_builtins/string.gleam and rt_js_obj.gleam
%% (StringGetOwnProperty / "length").
%%
%% INVALID UTF-8 POLICY (the one policy, for every walker below): a JS string
%% is always well-formed UTF-8 — every construction path maps lone surrogates
%% to U+FFFD (encode_codepoint, char_codes_to_string, from_code_point_loop) —
%% so a bad byte reaching here means the boundary that produced the string is
%% broken. Every walker therefore has NO per-byte fallback clause and crashes
%% with function_clause on one, at the string it was handed, instead of
%% quietly counting it as a codepoint or reporting end-of-string.
%%
%% TODO(Deviation): still not fully spec-correct — JS indexes by UTF-16
%% code unit, so astral-plane chars (U+10000+) should count as 2 indices.
%% A full fix needs UTF-16 string storage. Codepoint indexing matches
%% grapheme indexing for all BMP chars so this is strictly more correct
%% than the previous string.slice approach.
%%
%% Both entry points keep a one-entry per-process cache so the canonical
%% JS idiom `for (i = 0; i < s.length; i++) use(s[i])` is O(n) instead of
%% O(n^2):
%%   - string_codepoint_length caches {Bin, Len}: the first call scans,
%%     repeat calls on the same string are O(1).
%%   - string_char_at keeps a cursor {Bin, CharIdx, ByteOffset} and resumes
%%     the UTF-8 walk from the last position for forward access, so a
%%     sequential scan advances one codepoint per call instead of re-walking
%%     from byte 0 (O(i) per access).
%% Cache hits use `=:=`, which is O(1) when the argument is the identical
%% heap term (the common case: the same JsString value threaded through the
%% interpreter loop) and fails fast on different strings (size compared
%% first). Binaries are immutable, so a hit can never be stale; misses just
%% replace the entry. Caches are per-process, so concurrent VM processes
%% (generators, actors) are isolated and merely start cold.
