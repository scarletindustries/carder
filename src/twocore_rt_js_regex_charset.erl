%% Codepoint-set algebra for the JS regex translator: sorted disjoint ranges,
%% the operations §22.2.2 defines over them (union / intersection /
%% subtraction / CharacterComplement), simple case folding (scf), and
%% rendering a set back into a PCRE character class.
%%
%% Split out of twocore_rt_js_regexp_ffi so this half is what it looks like: PURE, with
%% no dependency on `re` and no knowledge of the JS pattern grammar. Its
%% caller (twocore_rt_js_regexp_ffi's v-mode class parser) walks the source and hands
%% operand sets down here; the ONLY thing that comes back is a set, or the
%% PCRE text of one. Callers never see the range representation's invariants
%% (sorted, disjoint, merged) — every exported function re-establishes them.
%%
%% A range list is [{Lo, Hi}] of codepoints, ascending and non-adjacent once
%% normalised. Strings (the v flag's \q{...} and properties-of-strings) are
%% lists of codepoints and are only touched by vfold_str/2 and vsplit_singles/2.
%%
%% CI (caseless, the i flag) changes the algebra per the spec: every primitive
%% operand set is mapped through simple case folding first
%% (MaybeSimpleCaseFolding, §22.2.2.4), and complement is taken over the scf
%% fixed points (AllCharacters in UnicodeSets+IgnoreCase mode, §22.2.2.6) —
%% NOT over all of 0..10FFFF. Complement-after-folding is what keeps e.g.
%% /[^k]/iv from matching "K": "K" folds to "k", which the complement excludes.
%% PCRE's caseless option then folds the subject at match time, completing
%% Canonicalize.
